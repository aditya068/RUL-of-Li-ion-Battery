# RUL-of-Li-ion-Battery
Developed a data-driven approach to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Li-ion batteries using machine learning techniques. Analyzed battery degradation data, implemented various algorithms. This project honed my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and battery health prognosis.
